            <p>
              I got married! A bit of background on this project: my hubs and I are both in the tech industry and big advocates of going green. I decided to extend our wedding's online presence from only guest information to giving our guests the ability to RSVP online.
            </p>

            <p>
              Project info: Created the homepage banner in Adobe Photoshop. Developed the website with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery), and used a node.JS server during development. Deployed site on AWS. RSVP functionality created with Ruby on Rails by <a href="http://joshminnich.com" target="_blank">the other Minnich</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can find the code up on my <a href="https://github.com/soogeanie">Github</a>. Looking for a wedding website? <a href="mailto:sujinminnich@gmail.com">Let's collab!</a>

            <p>
              About 2 months after starting at Blackbaud, I was pulled into the Alzheimer's retainer team. Our team completed 3 newly redesigned events back to back to back in about a 5 month period.

            <p>
              I participated in 2 deployments as the only developer on the project. The major haul was creating the home page for each fundraising event. I creatively used system template tags along with JavaScript to achieve the functionality within the design.

            <p>
              These donation forms are unique in that the donor can choose to donate to their local Salvation Army. This unique functionality was accommodated by building this form using our API and allowed us to have complete control over building out their design. I not only sat in on design consultation meetings from the beginning of the project but also ended up building out the forms myself.

            <p>
              I built out a set of responsive HTML emails for this client, one of which was a e-newsletter and the other a basic email. This was my first time coding a responsive html e-newsletter.  It was extremely intimidating at first but after lots of googling, I got the hang of it. I went from having 0 experience building responsive html emails to now having built over 20 for various clients and deployments.
